# Richmond Mutual Aid Supply Drive System

The purpose of this system is to streamline operations and broadcast better information about the supply drive efforts.

See the [system tests](https://github.com/jeremy6d/mutual_aid/tree/master/spec/system) for more details on specific workflows.

This app is custom built for Richmond Mutual Aid Distribution. If you'd like to fork this and install it for your own mutual aid efforts, you're welcome to, but there may be some stuff that's hard coded for Richmond. I would love to work with you to white label the software!
